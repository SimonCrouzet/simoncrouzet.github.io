My research centers around applying data science and AI concepts in biology. I'm developing bioinformatics tools and prediction model for studying biological systems.

Computational Virology
------
At the Institute of Biodiversity, Animal Health and Comparative Medicine (University of Glasgow), I worked on a viral host predictor in Julia. Using large genomic and ecological datasets, Babayan et al. ([Science, 2018](https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aap9072)) demonstrate the possibility of predicting animal reservoirs as well as the existence and identity of arthropod vectors from viral genome sequences alone, via machine learning. Together, we rewrote the entire pipeline from the ground up in the high-performance programming language Julia, extended the scope of our models to DNA viruses and new reservoir groups and/or vector groups, added structural data, and now offer better usability with an all-in-one feature engineering and model training user interface.


Computational Structural Biology
------
With the Laboratory of Computational and Quantitative Biology (Sorbonne University), I worked on an evaluation of docking conformations based on graph representation learning. From a database of complete cross-docking (CC-D), and integrating extra features such as regional classification of the interface residues or non-intrinsic properties of protein chains, we evaluate and identify near-native protein-protein docking models thanks to an end-to-end deep learning architecture, using graph convolutional and attention networks.


Genomics
------
At the Wellcome Sanger Institute (University of Cambridge), I worked on a pangenomics exploration of Anopheles Funestus (mosquito, major vector of malaria). By building a pipeline to call short and long-range structural variation events (SVs) using several bioinformatics tools (Minimap2, Svim-asm) from high-quality assemblies, we characterized, crossed and analyzed SVs from several specimen of the species.
