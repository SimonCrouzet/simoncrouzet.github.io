Hello there! I am a young passionate researcher with various experiences in computational biology, data science and bioinformatics. I received my master degree from the École Normale Supérieure de Paris (ENS-PSL), and I acquired through my research experiences an interdisciplinary and international academic background. I am currently working as a PhD student at EPFL in the Laboratory of Biomolecular Modeling.

I'm developing AI models and computational methods for structural biology, with a focus on protein and drug design.

I grew up in Grenoble, a medium size city in the French Alps in the foothills of the Chartreuse. As expected, I felt in love with the mountains, and I am spending time hiking, skiing, climbing, mountaineering or cycling. I am also doing photography, mostly landscapes as a way to share my admiration for places I'm discovering.

After some years of undergraduate studies at Grenoble, I moved in Marseille as an undergraduate student, studying Computer Science in the stunning campus of Luminy. I was nominated by the ISEP Exchange Program to do a semester abroad in Växjö, a small and peaceful city in the middle of Sweden. I then moved to Paris for my graduate studies, where I had the chance to live in Cité Internationale, a wonderful and unique campus reuniting researchers and intellectuals from around the world in a spirit of peace and unity. I spent my first year of master in Sorbonne Université (formely known as Université Pierre and Marie Curie) and my second year in Ecole Normale Superieure de la rue d'Ulm. I then moved to Basel to write my master thesis at the D-BSSE, a department of ETH Zurich. I stayed in Basel for a research internship at Roche, within the pRED department, in a position sponsored by the internship programme “Think Tank in Innovation and Sustainability” (IP2TIS).
