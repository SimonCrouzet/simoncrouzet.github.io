Currently, I am a master student at in the Department of Biology at École Normale Supérieure (ENS-PSL). I'm developing bioinformatics tools and prediction model for studying biological systems, and I'm planning to head towards a PhD position within the field.

Outside of research, you can find me hiking, cycling, climbing, skiing, and I'm also an amateur photographer.
